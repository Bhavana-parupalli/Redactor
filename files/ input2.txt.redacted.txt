Just an FYI

About a year ago ██████████████ had me send a sample ISDA Master to the 
referenced counterparty.  ███ has now left ECT to go with Azurix.  I got a 
call from the counterparty wanting to get some bids on some options and 
██████ said to pass the trade down to ███████████.  I called ███████████ and gave 
███ the scoop and also told ███ we did not have a master in place and to 
treat this like any other counterparty, i.e. contact Credit for approvals 
before trading, etc.  I just wanted to give you a head's up, in case we get 
the trade, we're not surprised.
